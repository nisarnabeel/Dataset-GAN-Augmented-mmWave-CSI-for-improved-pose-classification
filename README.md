# Dataset: GAN Augmented mmWave CSI for improved pose classification
 This refers to the dataset of the paper CSI4Free: GAN-Augmented mmWave CSI for Improved Pose Classification. In this work, we show how can you perform stable training of GANs with mmWave CSI. Using WGAN, we can create an arbitrarily large dataset. A subset of GAN-generated dataset can be accessed here: https://zenodo.org/records/10702154
